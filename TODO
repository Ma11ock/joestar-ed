Theming 
    themes would need to come with a colors file and a set of jsf files
    enabling a theme will symlink all the jsf files in your syntax folder to
    the themes' folder

Lua:
    Move the joe glopts to a linked list,
	make it so you can make more vars at runtime
    
    Should each extension be a module/library?
    Should Joestar builtins be a library?
    Should joestar vars be in their own global metatable?

JSF
    more bisqwit-style (c.jsf is his)

Extensions 
    Plugin manager

GUI
newb-friendly mode, like JPICO (JNote?)
    Make install file install jnoterc, and make a jnote symlink
    Help buffer
    Use ESC as Ctrl-C replacement

Vertical split windows
Automatically strip the binary

org-mode, or some type of note mode
make install script install into .config/joestar/
manage DEADJOE files by putting the in .config (so theyre out of the way)
clean up default joerc files, make them minimalist like VIM's
auto revert (decent chance joe might already have this)

relative line numbers (and hybrid line numbers)
    redo turning on and off linums, have it rely on the enum

bug fixes:
    I had a segfualt after putting in a strange key combo. Must find out
    what was...

mention bisqwit's c.jsf file in the README

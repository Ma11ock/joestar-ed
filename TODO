    Plugin manager

GUI
newb-friendly mode, like JPICO (JNote?)
    Make install file install jnoterc, and make a jnote symlink
    Help buffer
    Use ESC as Ctrl-C replacement

Vertical split windows
Automatically strip the binary

org-mode, or some type of note mode
make install script install into .config/joestar/
manage DEADJOE files by putting the in .config (so theyre out of the way)
clean up default joerc files, make them minimalist like VIM's

relative line numbers (and hybrid line numbers)
    redo turning on and off linums, have it rely on the enum

    I had a segfualt after putting in a strange key combo. Must find out
        what was...
    JOE cannot take cmd ARGS that have arguments (such has linum_mode)

* Long term goals
** Theming
There is currently too much complexity with how different configuration languages exist in joestar. Currently, the languages are:
- [ ] JSF Files (.jsf)
- [ ] Color/theme (.jcf)
- [ ] rc (joerc etc.) (these are deprecated in joestar, but aren't likely to be removed)
- [ ] Lua
1) The separation between the syntax files and the theme files means that the syntax files cannot make full use of the color themes. It would  be better if these were combined into a single format; a theme would provide the colors, plus means to configure the syntax highlighting state machine.
